# Crystal ball (a.k.a. hyperbolic fish-eye)
A crystal ball for exploring 2-dimensional hyperbolic space using the Poincar√© disc model (for display) and the hyperboloid model (for computation).  Drag all the points by dragging the ambient, or drag the points individually.  Draws edges as geodesic arcs.
