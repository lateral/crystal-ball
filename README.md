# Crystal ball (a.k.a. hyperbolic fish-eye)
A crystal ball for exploring 2-dimensional hyperbolic space using the Poincar√© disc model (for display) and the hyperboloid model (for computation).  Drag all the points by dragging the ambient, or drag the points individually.  Draws edges as geodesic arcs.

## Usage
Just open `index.html`.  You can use your own point and edge configurations by simply dropping them into the appropriate textareas and hitting the "update" button.  Points entered in this way should be on the hyperboloid.
